# 📊 IT Market Analysis & Salary Optimization Benchmarking

## 🔬 Project Overview
This project is a **Data Engineering** exercise designed to mitigate salary opacity within the IT sector, **principally in Spain**. Addressing the lack of transparency in job postings (particularly on platforms like `Tecnoempleo`), I developed an ecosystem that automates data collection and applies **benchmarking models** to impute missing data, generating a realistic and actionable market perspective.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Capabilities
- **Extraction (ETL):** Dynamic Web Scraping using `Python (Playwright)`, engineered for efficient navigation and data extraction across multiple platforms.
- **Data Processing:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cleaning with `Python`. Implementation of logic for record balancing and null value handling to ensure sample integrity.
- **Visualization:** - Rapid statistical analysis using `Seaborn`.
  - Interactive Dashboard in `Power BI` utilizing advanced `DAX` for calculating dispersion metrics and salary gaps.
- **Technical Background:** While this project focuses on BI, the code architecture and data processing efficiency are directly informed by my background in **C++ and algorithms**, ensuring a clean and scalable data structure.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Seniority Gap (102%):** The analysis reveals that the average salary for a Senior profile is double that of a Junior. This data highlights a significant **hiring risk aversion**: companies prefer to pay a 100% experience premium rather than investing in the development of emerging talent.
- **Market Opacity:** Only **35%** of the analyzed job postings explicitly state the salary. This information vacuum justifies the use of benchmarking models, allowing candidates and companies to make decisions based on real data rather than assumptions.
